            <p>
                I'm currently creating digital experiences at ARS that are beyond normal expectations.
                I carried out the effort by contributing to the Alrestion portfolio website, a responsive design that transitioned from React to Next.js's efficiency.
                I've crafted engaging animations and fluidly retrieved dynamic content from APIs,
                all while focusing on frontend mastery, to create an engaging online presence.
