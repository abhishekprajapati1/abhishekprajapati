            <p>
                I'm also a part of the Softication family, contributing to projects and being a vital team player.
                At Softication, I dived into the world of backend development and DevOps, helping create
                "Bakeroo" â€” a tool to manage bakeries smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked on the inner workings using Prisma, Express.js, and MongoDB, and made sure everything runs smoothly
                with Jenkins and Docker on AWS EC2.
                My role is essential to keep the project successful, and I'm proud to say that I'm still actively contributing.
                The journey we started together is ongoing, and I'm excited to see where it leads.
